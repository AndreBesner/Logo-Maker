## How to Contribute

Please get in contact with me through my GitHub! You can add addtional test scripts, do whatever with the code!!!


## Tests

Examples of each shape generated are in examples folder.

Please see included tests scrips. Once JEST is installed and configured for the project you can run them by typing `npm test` into the command line. I am hoping to one day introduce validation for colour selection and making the output image look nicer. I would also have liked to have a main Shape Class and extend each individual shape from it. Didn't have the time, may have forgot project deadline was day before Mother's Day!
Feel free to do this in meantime and let me know how it goes!
